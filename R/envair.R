#' envair: R-based tools for retrieving B.C.'s air quality monitoring data
#'
#' The envair packages provides functions for the retrieval and processing of B.C.'s air quality monitoring data
#'
#' @section envair functions:
#'     > General functions for retrieving air quality monitoring data such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level
#'           ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), total reduced sulphur (TRS) along with related meteorological
#'           data such as wind speed (wspd), wind direction (wdir), temperature
#'     > Functions for retrieving ventillation index data and ventillation index map
#'     > Functions for calculating metrics for air quality such as daily 1-hour maximums, daily 8-hour maximums,
#'            rolling 8-hour average, daily average concentrations
